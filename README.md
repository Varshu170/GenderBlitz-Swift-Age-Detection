**Project Title: Gender and Age Prediction from Facial Images using Convolutional Neural Networks**

**Overview:**
In this project, I developed separate convolutional neural network (CNN) models to predict the gender and age of individuals from facial images. My goal was to accurately classify gender (male or female) and estimate age based on facial features extracted from images.

**Approach:**
1. **Data Collection:** I obtained a dataset containing facial images along with corresponding gender and age labels.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The images were resized to a standard size (128x128 pixels) and converted to grayscale to reduce computational complexity. I also normalized the pixel values to improve model training.
3. **Model Architecture:** I designed two CNN models - one for gender prediction and one for age prediction. Both models consisted of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, flattening, and dense layers. Dropout regularization was applied to prevent overfitting.
4. **Model Training:** The gender model was trained using binary cross-entropy loss and the age model was trained using mean absolute error loss. I utilized the Adam optimizer for training and evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.
5. **Model Evaluation:** After training, I tested the performance of each model using a separate test dataset. I calculated the loss and accuracy of both models to assess their predictive capabilities.

**Results:**
1. **Gender Prediction:** The gender model achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting the gender of individuals from facial images.
2. **Age Estimation:** The age model provided estimates of the age of individuals based on facial features extracted from images.
3. **Model Performance:** Both models were evaluated on the test dataset, and their respective loss and accuracy metrics were recorded to measure their performance.

**Conclusion:**
My project demonstrated the feasibility of predicting gender and estimating age from facial images using CNN models. While the models showed promising results, further optimization and fine-tuning could potentially improve their accuracy and generalization to unseen data. This project lays the foundation for future research in facial image analysis and applications in various domains such as biometrics, social demographics, and human-computer interaction.
